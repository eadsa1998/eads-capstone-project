# Overview

For the final product of my capstone project, I chose to create a model using HuggingFace Transformers that summarizes the text of dream inputs and then generates images of those summaries. HuggingFace is an open-source natural language process technology platform that specializes in large language models, so they were a perfect candidate technology for my project. This model consists of two parts: a summarization model, which takes the texts of the dreams as inputs and returns a summary of those inputs, and an image generation model, which takes the outputs of the summarization model and generates images of the summaries. For the summarization model, I chose the linydub/bart-large-samsum model and the DALL路E mini text to image generation model created by the Flax community.
